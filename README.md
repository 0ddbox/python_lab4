In the project PyLab004, encapsulation and generalization are crucial for breaking down the drawing process into manageable and reusable components. Encapsulation allows complex tasks, like drawing a pumpkin or a star, to be broken into smaller, self-contained functions such as drawing a circle, square, or polygon. This makes the code more modular, easier to read, and debug. Each function is responsible for a specific task, and you can call these functions without needing to know their internal details. For example, instead of repeating the logic to draw a square every time, you simply use the draw_square() function when needed.

Generalization, on the other hand, enables you to reuse these functions in different contexts. For instance, the generalized draw_polygon() function lets you draw any regular polygon by specifying the number of sides and side length, which can then be adapted for various shapes like stars or jack-o'-lantern eyes, reducing the need for duplicated code.
